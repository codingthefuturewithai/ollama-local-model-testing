**Prompt Text:**
```
Implement a binary search function in Python that:

2. Returns the index of the target if found, -1 if not found
3. Uses the standard binary search algorithm (O(log n) complexity)
4. Includes proper error handling for edge cases
5. Add docstring with complexity analysis and examples

Please provide a complete, well-documented implementation.
```

**Input Artifacts:** None (algorithm specification only)

**Expected Output:**

### QC-02: Code Refactoring - Performance Optimization

**Description:** Test the model's ability to identify and fix performance issues in existing code.

def slow_search(arr, target):
    """Inefficient linear search implementation"""
    found_indices = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(len(arr)):  # Unnecessary nested loop
            if arr[i] == target:
                found_indices.append(i)
                break
    return found_indices

Requirements:
1. Fix the performance issues

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Removes unnecessary nested loop
- [ ] Correctly identifies all occurrences of target
- [ ] Explains the original performance issue
- [ ] Provides complexity analysis

        self.items = []
    
    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
    
    def pop(self):
        if len(self.items) == 0:
            return None  # Should raise exception
        return self.items.pop(0)  # Wrong end of list
    
    def peek(self):
        return self.items[0]  # Wrong end, no bounds check
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) > 0  # Wrong comparison

Requirements:
1. Fix all bugs while maintaining proper stack behavior (LIFO)
2. Add appropriate error handling
3. Explain each bug you found
4. Add a simple test to demonstrate correct functionality
```

**Input Artifacts:** `test-data/sample-code/code-samples.py` (BuggyStack class)
