Jennifer,

FYI - Emily Davis (emily.davis@startup.io) requested cancellation of order ORD-2024-004 (Mechanical Keyboard, $159.99). 

Reason: Found better price elsewhere ($139.99 on competitor site)

This is the 3rd price-related cancellation this week. Should we consider price matching policy?

Thanks,
Customer Service Team
