Perfect, thanks! Just to confirm - this is the 3-pack of USB-C hubs for our new office setup, right? We need them for the team meeting on Friday.

Hi Mike,

Yes, that's correct - 3x USB-C Hub units @ $25.99 each. Total: $77.97 plus shipping.
They should arrive Thursday, well before your Friday meeting.
