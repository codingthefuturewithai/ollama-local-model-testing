The 'Top 3 Customers by Order Value' list is incorrect; while John Smith and Lisa Garcia's individual order values are correct, they are not the top 3 customers by *order value* (the prompt asked for top customers by order value, not total spent across potentially multiple orders, though in this small dataset each customer only has one order). The ranking is wrong, and the third customer listed (Thomas Anderson) has a much lower order value than several others (e.g., Emily Davis, Robert Wilson). The product performance analysis correctly lists each product and its quantity sold and revenue generated based on the single order it appears in, but it doesn't aggregate performance if a product appeared in multiple orders (not applicable here, but a limitation).
