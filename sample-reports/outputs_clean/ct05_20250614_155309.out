# Fibonacci Function API Documentation
## Function Definition
```python
def fibonacci(n: int) -> list[int]:
"""Calculate the first n Fibonacci numbers.
The function computes and returns a list containing the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.
The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- For n > 1: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
Args:
n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate. Must be a non-negative integer.
Returns:
list[int]: A list containing the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.
If `n` is 0, returns an empty list.
Examples:
>>> fibonacci(0)
[]
>>> fibonacci(1)
[0]
>>> fibonacci(2)
[0, 1]
>>> fibonacci(5)
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
Time Complexity: O(n) - The function iterates n-2 times to compute the sequence.
Space Complexity: O(n) - The function stores all n Fibonacci numbers in a list.
Note:
This implementation uses an iterative approach for better performance
compared to recursive approaches, especially for larger values of `n`.
"""
if n <= 0:
return []
elif n == 1:
return [0]
elif n == 2:
return [0, 1]
fib = [0, 1]
for i in range(2, n):
fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])
return fib
```
## Usage Examples
```python
# Example usage of the fibonacci function:
print(fibonacci(0))   # Output: []
print(fibonacci(1))   # Output: [0]
print(fibonacci(2))   # Output: [0, 1]
print(fibonacci(5))   # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```
## Time and Space Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this implementation is O(n). This is because the function uses a loop that runs n-2 times to compute the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.
### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is also O(n), as the algorithm stores all n Fibonacci numbers in a list.
## Potential Improvements or Alternative Approaches
1. **Generator Implementation**:
- Instead of returning a list, you could implement this function as a generator that yields Fibonacci numbers one at a time, which would save memory for large values of `n`.
2. **Memoization/Caching**:
- For applications requiring multiple computations with the same n, memoizing results could improve performance by storing previously computed values.
3. **Matrix Exponentiation**:
- For extremely large values of `n`, using matrix exponentiation can significantly reduce time complexity to O(log n), though this approach is more complex to implement and generally used in scenarios where efficiency at scale is critical.
4. **Recursive with Memoization**:
- A recursive implementation with memoization could provide a clean, readable solution while maintaining good performance characteristics.
